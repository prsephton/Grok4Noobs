This project is a wiki which documents itself.  The idea is to have
a working grok project which explains how it is implemented.

Installation:

    pip install grokproject
    grokproject mygrok
    extract this project into mygrok/src/mygrok/
        cd mygrok/src/mygrok/
        git clone https://github.com/prsephton/Grok4Noobs.git
    edit mygrok/setup.py and change the entry_points section to contain
          'fanstatic.libraries': [
              'mygrok            = mygrok.resource:library',
              'mygrok.grok4noobs    = mygrok.grok4noobs.resource:library',
          ]
    cd ~/mygrok
    bin/buildout
    bin/paster serve --reload parts/etc/deploy.ini  # Starts the server

    Point your browser at localhost:8080 and log in.
    Create an instance of grok4noobs, and click on it's link.

    To load the database:
        cp ~/mygrok/src/mygrok/grok4noobs/db/* ~/mygrok
        from your browser, visit <your url>/restore
        You should get a message that the wiki data has been loaded
