This project is a wiki which documents itself.  The idea is to have
a working grok project which explains how it is implemented.

There is a working server at https://www.aptrackers.com/gfn with the latest copy
of the document.

Installation (linux):
    assuming you are in your home directory
    sudo pip install grokproject
    grokproject mygrok

    extract this project into mygrok/src/mygrok/
        cd mygrok/src/mygrok/
        git clone https://github.com/prsephton/Grok4Noobs.git

    edit mygrok/setup.py and
        add the following items below the # Add extra requirements here
                        'Pygments',
                        'zope.pluggableauth',
                        'zope.app.schema',

        change the entry_points section to contain
          'fanstatic.libraries': [
              'mygrok            = mygrok.resource:library',
              'mygrok.grok4noobs    = mygrok.grok4noobs.resource:library',
          ]

    cd ~/mygrok
    bin/buildout
    bin/paster serve --reload parts/etc/deploy.ini  # Starts the server

    Point your browser at localhost:8080 and log in.
    Create an instance of grok4noobs, and click on it's link.
