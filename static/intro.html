<h3>What is Grok?</h3>
<p><a title="Grok Web Framework" href="http://grok.zope.org/"><strong>Grok</strong></a> is (as of 2014) a relatively little known and used web framework, based upon the&nbsp;<a title="The Zope Toolkit API" href="http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/">Zope Toolkit</a> (ZTK) and the&nbsp;<a title=" ZCA Book" href="http://muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html">Zope Component Architecture</a> (ZCA).&nbsp; Development for this framework began in 2006, with the view to making Zope-3 technology more accessible to newcomers.&nbsp; It achieves this quite admirably by using a mix of convention, special Grok directives, and decorators to reduce or even eliminate the need for site configuration.&nbsp; This automatic configuration, implemented through a library called Martian,&nbsp; mostly happens at startup/load time and almost completely replaces the need for ZCML (Zope Configuration Markup Language).</p>
<h3>A Little History</h3>
<p>Zope-3, these days <a title="Bluebream Framework" href="http://bluebream.zope.org/">called BlueBream</a>, is probably the single most misundertood Python based web framework in use today.&nbsp; Although "In Disuse" might be a fairer comment.&nbsp; Even though it is also the oldest Python web framework, having been developed and in use since 1998, there has been a lot of Zope hatred in recent years.&nbsp; This sentiment is quite likely warrented; developers dislike wasting their time and feeling frustrated, and there are a lot of options, easier to learn and use than Zope-3, available today. Notably <a title="Pyramid" href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a>, <a title="Django" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a title="Web2Py" href="http://www.web2py.com/">Web2Py</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Flask" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> etc. and last but not least, <a title="Grok" href="http://grok.zope.org/">Grok</a>.</p>
<p>At one time&nbsp;<a title="The zope-2 home page" href="http://zope2.zope.org/">Zope-2</a> was the darling of the Python web development world.&nbsp; Zope-2 was based on a Through the Web (TTW) development model, which meant that developers could collaborate and program a Zope-2 installation remotely.&nbsp; It was fast (really fast and efficient for its time), simple, intuitive and had a large number of building blocks.&nbsp; To this day, Zope-2 remains popular as the basis for the Plone-3 CMS.</p>
<p>Zope-3 was intended to be a replacement for Zope-2, but this didn't quite work out as planned.&nbsp; As fast as features were added to Zope-3, they were back-ported to Zope-2 in a compatibility library called "Five" (5 = 2 + 3). This reduced and hampered motivation for adopting the new Zope-3 in favor of Zope-2.&nbsp; At the same time, Ruby and Rails happened which completely reimagined the way people looked at web frameworks.&nbsp; Django and other Python frameworks sprang up and quickly gained popularity as developers began to realise that Python web development didn't have to be a ghastly chore.&nbsp; Zope-2 popularised TTW development, but Zope-3,&nbsp;as was the case for most of the other Python frameworks, was not a TTW framework.</p>
<h3>So why is Grok important?</h3>
<p>Grok is arguably the single best way to make use of the over 15 years of accumulated intellectual capital which comprises the Zope Toolkit libraries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although BlueBream exists, along with it's amazingly complete set of documentation, the same reasons why people migrated away from Zope-3 in the first place persist today.&nbsp; It is unlikely that anyone would want to, nor is it entirely advisable to adopt the BlueBream framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pyramid was at least initially also based upon the Zope Toolkit.&nbsp; However, Pyramid takes the approach of wrapping and hiding the ZCA from it's users, and there is not much recognisable left of the original architecture.&nbsp; It tries hard to be a generalised solution for all your needs, and succeeds at this in many ways.</p>
<p>Grok, on the other hand is a completely different animal.&nbsp; With an initial investment of a few weeks to properly understand how to fully exploit the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA), Grok gives you a mature and well documented framework capable of delivering relatively complex products in comparatively very little time.</p>
<h3>What's this site all about?</h3>
<p>The Grok tutorial does a great job at showing off the simplicity of the framework.&nbsp; It is not so good though, at showing how to progress beyond the simple things, or how the ZCA can help you build great sites quickly and maintainably instead of being the millstone around everyone's necks they imagine it to be.&nbsp; The&nbsp; ZCA is the elephant in the room everyone is ignoring, and rather than being treated like the embarrasing relative, should be the first thing proudly introduced to newcomers.</p>
<p>In so many ways, Grok's choice of a cave man as an emblem is so very wrong.&nbsp; Whilst one understands the humour behind the cave man smashing obstacles, the overriding association is that Grok, like cavemen, is a relic of a prehistoric age.&nbsp; While one might argue that pyramids are not much newer, one must question and wonder at the marketing skills of Python developers.&nbsp; This must undoubtedly have contributed to the mindset where Zope, the ZTK, Grok, and most of the related technologies belong to a bygone era.</p>
<p>The intention of this site is to serve as a living monument to Grok and the underlying Zope Toolkit, as well as the amazing work done by the Zope developers over the years, and to demonstrate that although there are a lot of newer frameworks, newer code and architectures are not necessarily better than older code and architectures.</p>
